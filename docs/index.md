Welcome! This GitHub Pages site renders the math-heavy RLHF notes with full MathJax support. Use the links below to jump directly to the rendered guides:

- [RLHF Guide](./rlhf.html)

> 💡 **Tip:** Enable GitHub Pages under **Settings → Pages** and point it to the `docs/` folder on the `main` branch. Once the build completes, equations enclosed in `$$` or `$...$` will render beautifully.
