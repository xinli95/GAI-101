# GAI-101: Topic-Focused Learning Modules for Generative AI

GAI-101 is a modular learning repository designed to help developers and researchers understand,
implement, and deepen their knowledge across key areas of generative AI.

Each top-level folder represents a self-contained topic (for example: transformers, agents,
multimodal models, reinforcement learning, retrieval systems). Inside every topic, you will
find a consistent structure:

- **Tutorial** – a beginner-friendly introduction to core concepts  
- **Technical Deep Dive** – detailed explanations of algorithms, architectures, and design choices  
- **Minimal Implementation** – small, focused code examples demonstrating the essential ideas  
- **Paper Reading Notes** – summaries and analysis of influential papers relevant to the topic  

This structure allows readers to explore specific areas independently.  
You can jump directly to the topic you care about without needing to follow a linear sequence.

## Repository Organization

- Each folder = one generative AI topic  
- Topics are independent and self-contained  
- All topics follow the same four-part structure (Tutorial, Deep Dive, Implementation, Paper Notes)  
- You can treat the repository as a reference library, a study guide, or a hands-on sandbox

## Purpose

GAI-101 aims to provide:
- A unified, modular learning framework for generative AI  
- Clear conceptual explanations paired with runnable minimal examples  
- A bridge between theory (papers) and practice (implementations)  
- A resource you can read bottom-up (from a specific topic) or top-down (as a complete curriculum)

The goal is to make complex generative AI topics accessible, structured, and easy to explore at your own pace.
